# 2022-mooc-ecmwf-bocquet-brajard

This jupyter notebook has been created by Marc Bocquet and Julien Brajard
for the ECMWF MOOC of 2023 on Machine Learning in Weather & Climate. It has been reviewed and improved by Alban Farchi.
It also benefited from pieces of code previously developed by Marc Bocquet, Julien Barjard and Alban Farchi.
It explains how data assimilation and machine learning can be combined to achieve model discovery or model error correction.
It consists of an introduction, easily convertible into preliminary slides, and of three parts, meant to be used in sequence.
